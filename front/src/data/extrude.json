      "history": "Created in late 2024, employing extrusion techniques and hexagonal patterns to explore depth and form.",
      "element_info": "The exploration of patterns and materials in 3D takes on a new dimension with Extrude, part of the HEX collection. As its name suggests, this design is brought to life through an extrusion process, generating a surface brimming with depth and dynamism. Each piece plays with light and texture to emphasize volumes and contrasts, resulting in a hypnotic geometric composition. Modeled in Autodesk Maya and rendered in Keyshot, demonstrates how repetition and structure can transform simplicity into something visually striking.",
