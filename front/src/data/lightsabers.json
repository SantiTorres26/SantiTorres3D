      "history": "Started in 2023, this project represents my fascination with hard-surface modeling, which has driven my learning journey from the beginning.",
      "element_info": "These iconic weapons from a more civilized age—used by both Jedi and Sith—are reimagined through my own lens. Some lightsabers were modeled in Autodesk Maya, while others took shape in Blender. I explored various shaders, emissive effects, and metallic finishes, running material and lighting tests in both Blender and Keyshot to enhance their cinematic feel. This collection is a tribute to the timeless power and symbolism of the lightsaber.",
